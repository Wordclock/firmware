 * @file simple_random.h
 *
 *  This file implements a very simple 8bit random number generator.
 *
 *  \details
 *     Main Prinziple: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator\n
 *     This is based on Simon KÃ¼ppers code posted here: \n
 *         http://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/112114#998347 \n
 *     The postet version has a bug in the multiplikator that makes it unusable.
 *     This is fixed by using 17 as multiplikator.
 *     With the values 17/37 it has a peridicity of 256.
