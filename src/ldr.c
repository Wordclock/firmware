 *
 * It will read out the value from the ADC measurement started in the last
 * cycle and put it into array. It will then also recalculate the new value
 * for curr_sum, which is needed by ldr_get_brightness().
 *
 * If logging is enabled it will also output the value of the measurement
 * taken.
 *
 * It uses an counter in order to keep track of the current index for array.
 * It uses a modulo operation to get the new value of this index, which is
 * reason why LDR_ARRAY_SIZE should be a multiple of 2, so this can be
 * performed by a appropriate bit shift.
