 *
 * This file contains the implementation of the header declared in dcf77.h. In

 * overview of the concept. For a detailed description of the the time signal,
 * see [2].
 *
 * This moudule can detect the availability of the module itself and determine
 * whether it is active high or low. Furthermore it checks whether the internal
 * pull up resistor of the microcontroller is needed. Take a look at
 * dcf77_check_module_type() for details.
