/**
 * @file simple_random.c
 * @brief Implementation of the header declared in simple_random.h
 *
 * This module will generate **pseudo** random numbers. The principle is based
 * upon a concept known as Linear congruential generator, refer to [1] for
 * details.
 *
 * This is based upon Simon KÃ¼ppers code posted at [2]. However the posted
 * version has a bug in regards to the multiplier that makes it unusable. This
 * version fixes it by using 17 as a multiplier, see [3]. The periodicity of
 * this implementation of a RNG is 256.
