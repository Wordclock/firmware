 * This module handles the access to the brightness measured by the LDR sensor.
 * The returned brightness is the mean value of the last n measurements,
 * where n = MEASUREMENTS_ARRAY_SIZE.
 *
 * It is used to provide ambient light influenced behavior, e.g. increasing the
 * brightness of the LEDs involved when the light in the room the Wordclock is
 * in is switched on and/or changed.

 *
 * This is actually used as a [ring buffer][1], which means that

 * @brief Starts a new ADC conversion

 * using ldr_init(), otherwise this function won't have any effect at all.
 *
 * The measurement itself is being processed by the appropriate ISR
 * (ISR(ADC_vect)).
 *
 * The meaning of the register and bits are described at [1], p. 256f.
 *
 * As this function is pretty simple it is declared as "inline" and defined
 * directly within this header file, which keeps the needed program space
 * smaller.
