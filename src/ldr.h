 *
 * This module handles the access to the brightness measured by the LDR sensor.
 * The returned brightness is the mean value of the last n measurements,
 * where n = `MEASUREMENTS_ARRAY_SIZE`.
 *
 * It is used to provide ambient light influenced behavior, e.g. increasing the
 * brightness of the LEDs involved when the light in the room the Wordclock is
 * in is switched on and/or changed.
