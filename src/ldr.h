 * @brief Interface for handling access to the LDR sensor
 *
 * This module handles the access to the brightness measured by the LDR sensor.
 * The returned brightness is the mean value of the last couple of
 * measurements, defined by LDR_ARRAY_SIZE.
 *
 * It is used to enable the reaction to changes of the ambient light, e.g.
 * increasing the brightness of the LEDs involved when the light in the room
 * the Wordclock is in is switched on.
 *
 * @see ldr.c

 *
 * In order to keep the calculations fast this should be an multiple of two,
 * so calculations of the current index can be done by appropriate bit shifts.
