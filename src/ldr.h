 *
 * This module handles the access to the brightness measured by the LDR sensor.
 * The returned brightness is the mean value of the last couple of
 * measurements, defined by MEASUREMENTS_ARRAY_SIZE.
 *
 * It is used to enable the reaction to changes of the ambient light, e.g.
 * increasing the brightness of the LEDs involved when the light in the room
 * the Wordclock is in is switched on.

/**
 * @brief Number of measurements to take into account for calculating the brightness

 * of this size.
 *
 * This is actually used as a [ring buffer][1], which means that
 * MEASUREMENTS_ARRAY_SIZE should be a multiple of two to keep things fast.
