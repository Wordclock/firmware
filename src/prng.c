/**
 * @file prng.c
 * @brief Implementation of the header declared in prng.h
 *
 * This module is based upon a concept known as Linear congruential generator,
 * refer to [1] for details. It is based upon Simon KÃ¼ppers code posted at [2].
 * However, the posted version contains a bug in regards to the multiplier that
 * renders it quite useless. This implementation fixes it by using a different
 * multiplier, which is justified by [3]. The periodicity of this PRNG is 256,
 * which is exactly the width of the data types used internally.
