- Log output of DCF77 is buggy as the same timings are output various time,
  although internally nothing changed, see below:

- Log output of DCF77 is _ugly_. There are two spaces between each output,
  the lines get really long. Lines shouldn't get longer than 80 characters.

- Ambilight (sometimes?) enables itself after it was manually disabled.

- Ambilight enable/disable times: Just like the clock itself there should
  be an option to enable and/or disable the ambilight depending on the
  time, so it can be activated in the evening.

- Right now "enable_dcf77_ISR" is used to indicate whether or not the DCF77
  module is "enabled". Maybe this should be reworked so there are functions
  called dcf77_enable() and dcf77_disable(), which could be called instead
  of setting the flag directly to true and/or false.
